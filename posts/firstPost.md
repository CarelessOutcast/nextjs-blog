This is the first post; I'm understanding the difference between Pre-rendering
and server-side rendering. For performance, I want to leverage the Pre-rendering
architecture native to Nextjs. 

- ** Static Generation ** is the pre-rending that generates the HTML at
  build-time
- ** Server-side Rendering** is the pre-rendering that generates the HTML on
    **each request**.

The cool thing about Nextjs is that you get the option for every page. You can
choose to create a "hybrid site" that uses partial Static and SSR for others.
