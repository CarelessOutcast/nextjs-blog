# Simple Blog App

## Motivation: 
I've wanted to create a simple blog to start posting some of my findings and as
another project that I could build for my github. I decided that I would pick
nextjs because it's easy and fast to build. I don't want to worry too much on
all the small details and I want to create a production ready application. 

## Goal: 
I want a really barebone application that allows people to get added to mailing
list and to read some of the articles I produce. I want to make it easy for
people to get the main idea without spending too much time on the website. I would like
this to like a quick reference manual for intermediate programmers like myself
on their journey to being a better programmer in general.
